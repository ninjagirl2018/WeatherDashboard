WeatherDashboard

This weather dashboard application connects to the OpenWeather API to and pulls in 3 sets of data to display weather:  current weather conditions for any given city, the 5 day weather forecast for any given city, as well as the Longitude and Latitude objects returned from the initial API call to display the UV index for that given city.

The Application display is separated into 3 divs - List of cities searched, current city conditions and the current city's 5 day forecast.

The Application will store a set of pre-defined cities and display their various weather reports and keep those cities searches stored in Local Storage.  Additionally, the application will (WIP) replace the values in Local Storage to store a list of the most recently searched cities by a user.
